A Guide to Candy Vending Machines


Candy vending machines are one of the most popular types of automatic merchandisers. Some examples of candy include Skittles, Snickers, and M&Ms.

You can buy all kinds of candy vending machines, small and large. You can get machines that offer six different options, or you can get gigantic kiosks with hundreds of options. The big ones often take the form of vending machine kiosks. They can look like sail boats, cable cars, or other novelty shapes and forms. Beaver Vending sells Black Dog Woodwork designs, such as Wazoo Toys and Candy Cable Car kiosks.

Most candy machines, however, take the form of small machines offering 32 to 40 different selections. You can double up the selections for more popular items, devoting two or more slots for one product, if you want.

Almost all candy vending machines are of the see-through or glass-front variety. That way, consumers can see exactly what size candy they are getting. This is not the case for most soda machines, because most people already know that a standard can is twelve ounces.

North American Vending is one company that specializes in candy machines (as well as gumball machines).  If you want to choose from a wide variety of candy and gumball machines, check out NAV first.

If you are interested in buying a candy vending machine, make sure you have a set of possible locations in mind. Be sure to set the candy vending machine at an eye level that is appropriate to the location. If it is in or near a toy store for children, for example, set the machine at eye level of an average child. If the candy machine is in a train station, go for a more adult level. Never set the eye level higher than five or six feet, since children will always be your main customers.
