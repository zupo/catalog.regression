Chain Link Kennels


Allowing your dog to roam freely around your back yard may be wonderful for them but not for you. The amount of cleaning up you will have to do after them is never fun. You may be hosting an outdoor gathering and not want your dog to be all over people or food that is there. Even mowing the grass can be difficult when you have a dog to deal with. Of course there is also the issue of the phone company or the gas meter reader having to come out and not wanting to go into the yard due to the dog.

One of the best ways to take care of all these scenarios as well as others that may come up is with a chain link kennel. They are very nice to look at so they won’t be an eyesore in your back yard. They also are very roomy so they are perfect for larger dogs. They offer plenty of room to move around in as well as to see outdoors.

Some of these chain link kennels feature various tops as well. You can get one that is completely covered on the top so rain and wind won’t get to your dog. You can also get one that is protective so that the sun isn’t beating down on your dog during the hot days of summer. You can also go with the traditional style of chain link kennel without either feature for a lower cost.

The downside to chain link kennels though is that they aren’t movable very easy. They are big, bulk, and heavy. Yet your dog will be extremely comfortable in there and you can take care of what you need to without them bothering you. Some also have double gates so you can leave it open as one large kennel or break it up into two separate ones. This is perfect if you have more than one dog.

The prices on chain link kennels depend on the length, width, and height that you want them. It also depends on the type of roof you choose to have on it. Some start out as low as $300 while others are more than $1,000. You can find them at many pet stores as well as home improvement stores.
