Curb Your Enthusiasm (Season 3) DVD Review


Winner of a Golden Globe for Best TV Series (Comedy or Musical), and nominated for 20 Emmys, Curb Your Enthusiasm is among the more funny and best-written shows on television. Yet another popular HBO original series, the show is the product of Seinfeld writer and co-creator Larry David. Amazingly, Larry's life maintains a stunning resemblance to the somewhat fictional George Costanza. And just as George's life is dominated by low self-esteem and self-worth, Curb Your Enthusiasm harbors a similiar theme of what can go wrong, will go wrong. In a sense, it combines the clever "show about nothing" Seinfeld concept with today's penchant for reality TV...

The Curb Your Enthusiasm (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere "Chet's Shirt" in which Larry skips his dentist's dinner party in order to purchase waiters' uniforms for he and Ted Danson's restaurant venture. Along the way, Larry purchases matching shirts for himself and Danson, but when Ted discovers a small rip in his shirt, it causes a rift between the two which leads to further disasters for Larry… Other notable episodes from Season 3 include "The Benadryl Brownie" in which Larry and Richard Lewis conspire to bake Benadryl-laced brownies for Richard's hive-stricken, medication-averse girlfriend, and "Krazee-Eyez Killah" in which Larry is accused of betraying the confidence of Wanda Sykes's rapper boyfriend, Krazee-Eyez Killah…
