Frasier (Season 4) DVD Review


One of the funniest and most beloved comedies of its era, the Cheers spin-off Frasier remained a lynchpin in the NBC lineup for much of the 1990s. Following the life of eminent psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane in the aftermath of his divorce from Lilith, Frasier takes place in Seattle, Washington where the title character lives with his handicapped father Martin, a retired police officer wounded in the line of duty. The two are joined by Daphne Moon, a live-in housekeeper and physical therapist, and Martin’s dog Eddie who is constant irritant to Frasier. Recurring characters include Frasier’s brother Niles and Frasier’s producer Roz Doyle…

The Frasier (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including one episode (#77) where Niles’ head of hair becomes the good luck charm which turns the Sonics basketball season into one of playoff contention. Niles becomes an instant celebrity and wins over Marty’s approval… Bebe Neuwirth returns in her role as Frasier’s ex-wife, Dr. Lilith Sternin, in a special Thanksgiving episode where Frasier and Lilith join together to aid in Frederick’s admission to a prestigious school... In the season finale, a desparately single Frasier rushes to the airport to pick up a woman, Laura (Linda Hamilton), who mistakenly left a message on his answering machine…
