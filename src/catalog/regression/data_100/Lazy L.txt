Lazy L


Taking a page out of western naming conventions, the Lazy L in Willow Creek, Delaware was built specifically as a bed and breakfast. The Lazy L is ideal for the birdwatcher in you. The marsh comes alive with Eagles, Osprey, and Herons. Enjoy nature's beauty from the screen porch or indoor lounge. This three-story delight is also pet friendly.

There are five spacious rooms in addition to a private cottage. The Nature Room is above average in size for a bed and breakfast. With a queen sized sleigh bed, it offers a superb view of Red Mill Creek. On the second floor is the Lighthouse room. In addition to the large double windows for an excellent view, there is an alcove in which to store your beach gear. Also on the second floor is the Mermaid room and shares two rooms with the others on this floor. From here you are offered an excellent view at the front of the Lazy L. On the lower level is the Key West Room.

Adjacent to the Key West room is a large sitting area and a walk out patio that it shares with the Flamingo room. The lounge area of the Flamingo room comes complete with all the kitchen amenities.   Sit on the deck and enjoy the sunrise or just enjoy the ducks out on the creek. Unique to the Lazy L is a small private cottage lovingly called Cottage in the Dog Run.

The full sized complimentary breakfast includes such luxuries as quiche and crepes along side the full compliment of fruits and breads. After a hearty breakfast, head down to the creek and spend the day kayaking. If you prefer the less intimidating activities a heated swimming pool, hot tub, and pool table are provided. To complete the nature enjoyment, a picnic area is also provided.
